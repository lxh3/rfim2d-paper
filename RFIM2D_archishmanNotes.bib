@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The traditional transcritical bifurcation normal form~\cite {Strogatz14} $dw/d\ell = w^2$ is derived using the implicit function theorem, but involves changes of variables that alter critical properties in singular ways. Eq.~\ref {eq:TruncNF} is the simplest form that can be reached by successive polynomial changes of variables."}
