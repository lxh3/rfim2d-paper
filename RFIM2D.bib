  abstract={Many systems crackle, from earthquakes and financial markets to Barkhausen effect in ferromagnetic materials. Despite the diversity in   essence, the noise emitted in these dynamical systems consists of avalanche-like events with broad range of sizes and durations, characterized by power-law avalanche distributions and typical average avalanche shape that are fingerprints describing the universality class of the underlying avalanche dynamics. Here we focus on the crackling noise in ferromagnets and scrutinize the traditional statistics of Barkhausen avalanches in polycrystalline and amorphous ferromagnetic films having different thicknesses. We show how scaling exponents and average shape of the avalanches evolve with the structural character of the materials and film thickness. We find quantitative agreement between experiment and theoretical predictions of models for the magnetic domain wall dynamics, and then elucidate the universality classes of Barkhausen avalanches in ferromagnetic films. Thereby, we observe for the first time the dimensional crossover in the domain wall dynamics and the outcomes of the interplay between system dimensionality and range of interactions governing the domain wall dynamics on Barkhausen avalanches.},

  abstract={The scaling laws derived by Grinstein (1976) for the random-field Ising model (RFIM) are rederived on the assumption that the transition is second order and that the critical behaviour is controlled by a zero-temperature fixed point. The scaling laws involve three independent exponents nu , eta and gamma , the last appearing in a modified hyperscaling relation, 2- alpha =(d-y) nu . It is argued that such hyperscaling modifications are a general feature of phase transitions controlled by zero-temperature fixed points. Explicit evaluation of the RFIM exponents in d=2+ epsilon dimensions, yields, to order epsilon , 1/ nu = epsilon , eta =1- epsilon /2 and y=1+ epsilon /2. The exponent nu is different from that of the pure model in (d-y) dimensions implying that no exact 'dimensional reduction' is possible near two dimensions.}

  abstract="We report studies of the behaviour of a single driven domain wall in the 2-dimensional non-equilibrium zero temperature random-field Ising model, closely above the depinning threshold. It is found that even for very weak disorder, the domain wall moves through the system in percolative fashion. At depinning, the fraction of spins that are flipped by the proceeding avalanche vanishes with the same exponent $\gamma$ = 5/36 as the infinite percolation cluster in percolation theory. With decreasing disorder strength, however, the size of the critical region decreases. Our numerical simulation data appear to reflect a crossover behaviour to an exponent $\gamma${\textasciiacutex} =0 at zero disorder strength. The conclusions of this paper strongly rely on analytical arguments. A scaling theory in terms of the disorder strength and the magnetic field is presented that gives the values of all critical exponent except for one, the value of which is estimated from scaling arguments.",

  abstract={In our studies of hysteresis and avalanches in the zero-temperature random-field Ising model, a simple model of magnetism, we often have had to do very large simulations. Previous simulations were usually limited to relatively small systems (up to 900/sup 2/ and 128/sup 3/), although there have been exceptions. In our simulations, we have found that larger systems (up to a billion spins) are crucial to extracting accurate values of the critical exponents and understanding important qualitative features of the physics. We show three algorithms for simulating these large systems. The first uses the brute-force method, which is the standard method for avalanche-propagation problems. This algorithm is simple but inefficient. We have developed two efficient and relatively straightforward algorithms that provide better results. The sorted-list algorithm decreases execution time, but requires considerable storage. The bits algorithm has an execution time that is similar to that of the sorted-list algorithm, but it requires far less storage.},

We discuss a new method allowing us to reduce the measurement noise, taking advantage of the acquisition of a whole temporal sequence of images. The resulting avalanche distributions give interesting hints as to the magnetization dynamics, but are strongly dependent on the size of the observation windows chosen. We investigate the effects of window size by studying finite-size scaling, and use this to extract the fractal dimension critical exponent 1/σν.}

  abstract={We study zero-temperature hysteresis in the random-field Ising model on a Bethe lattice where a fraction c of the sites have coordination number z = 4 while the remaining fraction ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/49/23/235001/jpaaa214dieqn1.gif] {$1-c$} have z = 3. Numerical simulations as well as probabilistic methods are used to show the existence of critical hysteresis for all values of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/49/23/235001/jpaaa214dieqn2.gif] {$c\gt 0$} . This extends earlier results for c = 0 and c = 1 to the entire range ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/49/23/235001/jpaaa214dieqn3.gif] {$0\leqslant c\leqslant 1$} , and provides new insight in non-equilibrium critical phenomena. Our analysis shows that a spanning avalanche can occur on a lattice even in the absence of a spanning cluster of z = 4 sites.}
